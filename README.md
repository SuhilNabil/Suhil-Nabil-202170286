# AI Chatbot with Emoji

This project is an interactive chatbot application that uses both OpenAI's GPT model and a database of pre-defined responses. It is built with Python, leveraging the tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI), and it allows users to chat with the bot using emojis. The chatbot supports saving and retrieving responses from a database and can be extended with additional responses via CSV files.

# Features
Interactive Chatbot: Users can send messages and receive replies from the chatbot, with responses generated by OpenAI’s GPT or selected from pre-defined responses.
Emoji Support: Chat interface enhanced with emojis for a more engaging user experience.
Data Persistence: Pre-defined responses are stored in an SQLite database, allowing for easy retrieval of past conversations.
CSV Import: Load custom responses from CSV files into the database for enhanced flexibility.
Manual Feedback: Users can provide feedback for responses that the bot does not know, which are then stored in the database for future use.
